        <li><i>Home Page</i>: For Home page, I have added simply added welcome text and contact button with simple black background.</li>
        <li><i>Portfolio Page</i>: It contains simple four dummy images prepared by using grid property. The image hovers when the user rolls over the images. Also, the page has been made responsive for mobile view.</li>
        <li><i>Contact Page</i>: Here, form tag is used and when the user fills the given details, on clicking submit button, the details get sent to given email on action attribute.
